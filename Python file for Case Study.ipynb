With businesses being shut, travel being banned, schools, and colleges being closed, we have observed an impeccable amount of sorrow and despise along with a great amount of mental torture and destruction. Though situations are improving now, and the lockdowns are being lifted, it is a fact that it cannot be shunned that this virus will have a long term impact on people, and the effects will not only be felt economically and physically but also mentally. We\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve been reading articles regarding the impact of COVID 19 on the economy, education, mental health, and every other possible aspect. But one topic which has not been talked about much is the impact of COVID 19 on office space and co-working industries. Well, it is quite obvious that offices will start functioning now, but, the COVID period hasn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t ended. This means that social distancing will also have to be followed in offices; where it will be a problem to do so because of the lack of adequate infrastructure and space. The same will be the condition in co-working industries, wherein employees of different companies come and work together under the same roof. However, these problems are quite obvious (though people haven\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t thought about them much), but the fact which people fail to notice and understand is that the meaning of space is not only limited to infrastructural space which is measured in square foot or square meters; but it also extends to metal space, or for that fact, space in the minds of people for others and their thoughts as well as opinions. Coronavirus has left a big scratch in our country; just the way a car needs repair after an accident, our country will also need repair after the control of this virus. But, unlike a car, our country will require a large amount of time to get restored and to stand straight without any support. Needless to say, the economic stability of our country will definitely be hit because of this reason. But the problem is since the earnings of the employers will reduce, it will subsequently lead to a drop in the salary of the employees. While some employees might be preferred by their bosses and may receive a raise regularly, others might be subjected to unfair treatment and made to do the same amount of work for a lower salary. People tend to overlook the thin line which exists between cooperation and competition. The problem doesn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t arise when such a situation happens wherein an employee is getting paid more than the other, but instead, it arises when people start to compare their earnings as well as benefits to that of others. And in today\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s world, where people keep money at the top of their priority list, comparisons will play a very important role in the performance of employees and their company. Since there will exist inequalities and partialities in companies, there will also exist a sense of hatred and competition among the employees of the same company; who will compete to get a better position or a raise in their salary. This may seem beneficial to some as it might compel the employees to work harder and better, but however, will bring huge losses in the long run. The fact is; employees might end up doing unethical acts which will help them to make a better impression in their boss\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s eyes. Moreover, since there will be comparisons among the employees, it might happen that the \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0098Employee of the Month\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 ends up being hated by all other employees in the company. Another situation that might arise is that of bluffing and pretending; wherein employees tend to show that they work very hard but they don\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t. This might be practiced by showing the boss that they are working when he is on around, and then chilling the rest of the time when the boss goes home or sits in his office. In fact, employees might also lose interest in working if they sense repeated partialities and inequalities; which they might show by quitting the jobs or not performing to their best. Such situations will definitely arise in companies and offices; wherein employees will compete for attention and resources; which will have a great impact on the company and its functioning. And all this will happen because of only one thing; lack of office mental space i.e. space in the minds of people working together in a particular office for cooperation and teamwork, along with ignorance of the fact that things will get better and eventually the same after some time. Another kind of industry and companies that will be affected due to the long-lasting impact of COVID 19 is the co-working industry and offices. This is because, there will be a shortage of resources and the income of people, but the maintenance cost to be born for the infrastructure, as well the rent will remain the same. Because of this, employees will be told by the company owners to exploit the resources present in the offices and use them to the fullest; to compensate for the losses being born and to make better use of the money being used. However, the number of resources will be the same, and so, there will be a case of competition between employees of different companies to use resources and take benefits of the same. If the above two situations happen to occur at the same time (which they most likely will), we will observe a scene of intra-company as well as inter-company competition. Also, our personal relations with other employees in the company might also be affected due to this comparison and competition; which itself will be a result of limited mental space. COVID 19 will have severe impacts on the office (mental) space of companies and people.\\u00c2\\u00a0 People\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s thoughts, how they treat others, along with accepting defeat and rejection will be an important aspect of everyone\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s lives. Moreover, we might also observe a shoot in the intensity and frequency of office people going to psychologists; because of repeated rejection and unfair treatment. However, we need to cope with this thing and realize that it is indeed very important for us to start preparing to expand our mental space and that this competition and comparison will not stay for long and should not affect our personal relations and life at any cost. Blackcoffer Insights 18: Archit Khandelwal, Shishukunj International School, Indore\",\n          \"From what I have learned on the mobile apps development market recently, it is becoming harder for an Android or iOS developer to find a suitable and well-paying job in the market. Some major reasons include the increasing supply of mobile engineers, people generally stop downloading apps, and many more. In this article, I will go through a more detailed explanation of the recent trend mentioned above and my two cents on what mobile engineers could do to prepare themself for the upcoming challenge! and the future of mobile apps. Coding Bootcamps Increase the Supply Side for mobile apps \\u00c2\\u00a0Developers Although the demand for mobile developers has not fallen sharply compared with previous years, the growth rate has slowed. On the other hand, owing to a great number of coding boot camps that target to bring up mobile and frontend engineers, a great number of developers are\\u00c2\\u00a0flooding into the developer job market. The supply side for mobile engineers has increased rapidly in recent years, raising the standards for qualified mobile engineers. The days of a mobile engineer easily getting over 10 job offers are over. Recode ran\\u00c2\\u00a0an article in mid-2016, that begins: \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cThe mobile app boom kicked off in July 2008, when Apple introduced the App Store. Now it is over.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d According to\\u00c2\\u00a0data\\u00c2\\u00a0gathered and analyzed by the\\u00c2\\u00a0CakeResume\\u00c2\\u00a0team, JavaScript and Python are now the most in-demand programming languages for companies who post product development jobs on CakeResume, both together taking up almost half of the job opportunities, while mobile engineers taking up merely 10% of the job opportunities. learn more about tech salaries in Taiwan Tech Salaries in Taiwan 2019 Overview People Stop Downloading mobile apps While App usage continues to grow and revenue also ascends, the majority of consumers actually download\\u00c2\\u00a0zero apps per month let\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s face the truth, born and raised up in the era of the information explosion, individuals don\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t have the leisure to check on what\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s new on the app store every day. When it comes to choosing an App to download, many people feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of options available. Take the productivity category of the App Store as an example, there are over thousands of Apps in this category, and new Apps popping up almost every week. It is almost impossible for users to dig through and learn all the apps. They just choose what is on top then click Install. And not to mention that if you could build an awesome productivity app, Google and Apple could do it 10 times better and faster than you. In the end, there\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s not as much need for individual apps to accomplish similar convenience factors. What You Could Do to Prepare for The future Changes for mobile apps Although the bull run for mobile development has ended, there are still over 2 billion smartphone users, 27.5 billion mobile apps downloaded, and time spent per day on mobile devices has increased rapidly in recent years. Moreover, apps offer a user experience that even \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0098Responsive Websites\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 are unable to provide. In order to stay on top of the game, you will have to differentiate yourself from the pack \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 other mobile engineers. If you are a mobile engineer who only knows how to code and tweak your App\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s UI, you aren\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t that different from others after all. Below I listed a few ways that you could implement so that you could stay competitive in the job market. 1. Choose Newer Technologies When You Have the Chance If you are an Android developer, you could start choosing a job involving Kotlin or Flutter, which are backed by Google. If you are an iOS developer, try to look for a job to get involved with using Swift. Although older mobile coding languages, such as Java and Objective-C, still have their upsides, the main reason why Kotlin and Swift are created at first is to address the older languages issue. It means that Kotlin and swift provide many safety mechanisms available out-of-the-box while being more concise and expressive than Java and Objective-C at the same time. Kotlin vs. Java: Which One You Should Choose for Your Next Android App A detailed comparison of Java and Kotlin to help you decide which language will work best for your next mobile\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6\",\n          \"Marketing can be defined as an act of promotion or advertisement of selling products or services. It is the process of exploring, creating, and delivering value to meet the needs of the consumers by understanding the target consumer market and particular businesses. It has evolved into a new form especially due to the excessive use of social media. Due to the boost in the use of social media, it is easier for businesses to market and advertise their business or the products and services offered by them. It affects both businesses and consumers in a significant manner. How does marketing influence business? In the words of Peter Drucker: \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cBecause the purpose of business is to create a customer,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00afthe business enterprise has two\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093and only two\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093basic functions: marketing and innovation. Marketing and innovation produce results; all the rest are costs. Marketing is the distinguishing, unique function of the business.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d Marketing doesn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t just \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cimpact\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d a business \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 it is the function that saves a company from closing down. Marketing has various benefits for business such as \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 Increasing Opportunities Marketing your business can have a huge impact on new businesses by creating large barriers for them to enter a well-established market. The new companies, brands, and businesses marketing, and advertisement can play a significant in making consumers aware of the products and services they are offering. Sales Assistance While a company can sell out its products to larger customers. With the assistance of various marketing tactics, they can significantly improve their brand awareness and make their product more visible to a larger audience, which in turn increases both sales and revenue. Marketing can help in identifying the buying behavior of consumers as well. Market Awareness Whether you are a new company or an established one, they need to create awareness about their product to boost their sales and revenue. Making use of correct marketing tools can help businesses in reaching out to more customers, therefore, creating awareness about the product. \\u00c2 Strategy Formulation It has a huge impact on the functioning of the business. A business marketing strategy is what you offer, how you offer, and whom you offer. Whenever a company forms a marketing strategy they are thinking about the future success of the business. They make sure that they understand consumer needs, and what they want and they know how to communicate well with the target audience so they understand the offer they are offering.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":6}],"source":["extracted_df.head()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":7,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":4,"status":"ok","timestamp":1717301882038,"user":{"displayName":"Uday Balaga","userId":"03661234437300315958"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"OWUhMaxqGAyn","outputId":"ab0d5ddd-6f64-464c-b7ce-69b1a1517dda"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["             URL_ID                                              Title  \\\n","0   blackassign0001  Rising IT cities and its impact on the economy...   \n","1   blackassign0002  Rising IT Cities and Their Impact on the Econo...   \n","2   blackassign0003  Internet Demand's Evolution, Communication Imp...   \n","3   blackassign0004  Rise of Cybercrime and its Effect in upcoming ...   \n","4   blackassign0005  OTT platform and its impact on the entertainme...   \n","..              ...                                                ...   \n","93  blackassign0096  Due to the COVID-19 the repercussion of the en...   \n","94  blackassign0097  Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on office space an...   \n","95  blackassign0098  Contribution of handicrafts (Visual Arts & Lit...   \n","96  blackassign0099  How COVID-19 is impacting payment preferences?...   \n","97  blackassign0100  How will COVID-19 affect the world of work? - ...   \n","\n","                                                 Text  \n","0   We have seen a huge development and dependence...  \n","1   Throughout history, from the industrial revolu...  \n","2   Introduction In the span of just a few decades...  \n","3   The way we live, work, and communicate has unq...  \n","4   The year 2040 is poised to witness a continued...  \n","..                                                ...  \n","93  Epidemics, in general, have both direct and in...  \n","94  COVID 19 has bought the world to its knees.

Like an insatiable glutton, the law of averages has come home to roost. We should\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve taken the hint when on the 1st of January, 66 people lost their lives in the Jakarta floods. What followed was like the highlights reel of a disaster movie franchise \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 a volcanic eruption in The Philippines, irrepressible bushfires in Australia, earthquakes in Russia, Iran, Turkey, India, and China. And speaking of China. 2020 has brought home the fragile mortality of the human race into sharp focus. As global Covid-19 deaths stoutly push past the grim 1 million marks, we have no choice but to question our place in the universe \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 are we the all-conquering masters of our domain, or mere tourists in a ruthlessly apathetic ecosystem? Is the human race on the ubiquitous three-part literary arc that defines every story, every life, every civilization \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 ascent, apex, and descent? Maybe when Michael Jackson unveiled his moonwalk in 1983, or when Barack Obama stepped into the White House as President of the United States in 2008, or indeed when MS Dhoni lifted the Cricket World Cup in 2011, we peaked, as a species, and everything since then has been a steady unraveling. 500 years is a long time. For context, the world population in 1500 AD was a mere 461 million. The 16-fold explosion since then is unprecedented in history, but we might just be at the tip of an iceberg. Though fertility rates are dropping and more and more people are foregoing the chance to have babies, we might just have crossed the threshold \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 the population projections for the year 2050 is 9.8 billion, and for 2100 is a whopping 11.2 billion1. Somewhere out there, Malthus is cackling in his grave. The year 2500 suddenly seems a long way off, and this conversation seems ever-more pertinent today. The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists is not optimistic \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 the famed Doomsday Clock they maintain is the closest to \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0098midnight\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 (our proximity to global catastrophe), since its inception in 1947. Global warming? Check. The threat of nuclear war? Check. Ongoing pandemic? Check, check, check. And yet, hope floats, for three reasons. Mankind may just have its back to the wall right now, but there are three shoots of potential that might just help us make it to 2500 AD \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 the advent of a basket of disruptive technologies (artificial intelligence, bio-enhancement, genetic engineering), the private sector focus on space exploration and terraforming, and good old fashioned human resilience. While the first two factors will no doubt be critical to human survival, it is the third one that we must pin our hopes on \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 our long-demonstrated history of surviving whatever nature, the universe, or our own self-destructive tendency, throws our way. The Next Superman? In the 13th century, in the Italian town of Pisa, an enterprising tinkerer developed the first eyeglasses, for a local friar with weakening eyesight2. All of a sudden, there existed an external device that could amplify our senses, a tool that gave us an advantage in survival. Today, LASIK surgeries obviate the need for eyeglasses entirely. Hearing aids give the gift of auditory perception back to those who had gotten used to a world of muffled voices and unheard sounds. The iPhone routinely comes with an augmented reality tool that allows us to measure the length of objects in front of us. But the real science starts where the imagination ends \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 augmented reality glasses, smart wearables, and virtual reality tools will be ubiquitous in the next few decades. But what after that? Science has the answer, and it\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s both thrilling and scary. Artificial intelligence has become the stuff of fable, the filler for all questions left unanswered. But AI, combined with bio-enhancement and genetic engineering, might just lead to the evolution of what some are calling Homo nouveau3. Homo nouveau will be smarter, faster, more agile, and better equipped to adapt to what promises to be a world that is VUCA beyond our imaginations. What might such a human being look like? They might have a small chip embedded in their brain that utilizes artificial intelligence for enhanced sensory perception. What does that mean? It means that they would be able to see better, focuses their attention for longer, hears what they want to hear, and communicate the appropriate reaction to the rest of the body. Through a chemical in the blood, this AI chip would be able to demand the appropriate response from the body. Bio-augmentation of limbs and organs, internal and external, would mean that what a person can or cannot do is no longer determined at birth, but can simply be bought. All of a sudden, the average Joe can run faster than Usain Bolt, swim better than Michael Phelps, and\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6fly? Maybe. Genetic engineering will be the missing link. Already there are feverish conversations about a dystopian future featuring designer babies and a digital divide that simply cannot be overcome because it is inbuilt into one\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s DNA. The breakthrough with CRISPR-Cas9 might just be the key to unlock the mysteries of DNA manipulation. So what if there\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s no food left? Our body AI will adjust our appetite accordingly. No water? Absorb humidity from the air through specialized pores in the skin. The human being in 2500 AD may not be how we recognize one today. That may be our only shot. Galactic Dominance SpaceX, led by its mercurial leader Elon Musk, has been the leader here. The SpaceX Mars Programme is based on a very simple premise \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 as the earth\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s closest planet in terms of distance and terrestrial conditions, Mars would be our best bet for colonization. Musk has invested billions of dollars in the Mars Space Programme and remains a fervent believer in the concept. And among tech visionaries, Musk is not alone. Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world, owns Blue Origin, which simply aims to make spaceflight cheaper through incremental technological growth. Bezos, who took an online retailer of books and turned it into an ever-expanding behemoth, is not a man who thinks small. With more and more business leaders finding spaceflight and planetary colonization a tantalizing prospect, there will inevitably be a concerted push to developing an actual colony on another planet. And when the pull-factor to this development starts hitting diminishing returns, there will be the inevitable push factor as global warming and the possible increase in the eruption of pandemics begin to take their toll. It might just become a more feasible option for people to find an alternate home, if not on Mars, then on one of Saturn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s moons. A human colony on Mars sounds like a concept straight out of science fiction, but so did a permanent station in Antarctica until a few decades ago. Mount Everest seemed like an unapproachable summit until someone went ahead and planted a flag at the peak. Today, hundreds of people every year attempt the climb. As spaceflight becomes more reasonable, as the urge to explore supersedes the inertia of investment, we become closer to our best chance of survival \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 leaving planet earth behind and finding another home, perhaps one more forgiving of our follies. The Human Spirit The introduction to this article includes an illustrative list of disasters and misfortunes that have struck the global community this year. And yet, we survive. Businesses surge ahead, people adapt to a world of masks and social distancing, the world goes on. Earthquakes, tsunamis, pandemics, we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve seen them all before and survived, and the human race, in its intrepid exploration of the world, pushes onward and upward. Technological visionaries envision a future that the rest of us cannot see, and then invest money in their vision. Gradually, what seemed unthinkable suddenly becomes real \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 the moon landing is the best possible example of that. Google launched Google Glass as the first augmented reality wearable technology, and suddenly we could foresee a future with smart eyewear. While the product didn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t quite catch on, that doesn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t mean other companies aren\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t trying. Bio-augmentation is already a fast-developing industry, while CRISPR-Cas9, the \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cgenetic scissors\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d is being held back only by regulatory bottlenecks. How long before the prospect of fiddling with the gene code becomes not a luxury but a necessity? The human spirit, the tendency to survive and thrive at all costs, will eventually win. The human race will survive to 2500, of that there is no doubt. The real question is, will the person who exists in 2500, with bionic chips and a bio-enhanced body structure and a modified genetic code, be called a Homo sapien? Or is Homo nouveau the way forward? Blackcoffer Insights 21: Ayush Kumar, XLRI Jamshedpur\",\n          \"Abstract Artificial intelligence and employment are the burning issues nowadays workers need clarity on as we head into the longer term. This article focuses on the various impact of AI on our jobs and explains the benefits of AI in our workplace. That right there must have hit a nerve. However, everything is about to change because this article highlights some of the reasons we should not fear AI. What is AI? AI is the abbreviation of Artificial Intelligence. Artificial intelligence is often defined as a set of various technologies which will be brought together to permit machines to act with what appears to be human-like levels of intelligence. This includes learning rules required to make certain decisions and reasoning to arrive at certain conclusions, learning from past experiences, and self-correction. AI is of two types. Narrow/Weak AI \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 AI solution designed and trained for a specific task.Strong AI \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 An AI solution whose intelligence matches that of a human brain across multiple & differentiated task. Key Moments in the AI Journey 1940 Expectations that machines could match humans in terms of general intelligence. By that, we mean machines could have the capability to find out, Reason, and React. 1950 Alan Turing develops the Turing Test; a test to determine whether a machine is intelligent.However, it wasn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t for another 60 years or so that any program was deemed to have passed. 1955 The first time a computer virus defeats a person\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s World Champion during a parlor game. 1956 John McCarthy invents the new term \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0098Artificial Intelligence\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 when he held the primary Academic Conference on the subject of AI. 1962 Arthur Samuel\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0098s machine learning checkers (draughts) program, beat a checkers master. 1980 Reinforcement Learning is introduced. This is a kind of programming that uses rewards and punishments to coach a machine to interact with its environment. 2012 A research group led by Geoffrey Hinton wins the Image Net competition \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 this competition requires AI to categorize about 1.2 million images into any of 10,000 different categories. The level of accuracy was adequate to that of the typical human completing an equivalent task manually. 2014 Eugene Goostman\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s chatbot, a bot pretending to be a 13-year-old boy, supposedly passes the Turing Test, a test which nobody has passed before! But controversy arose with this claim as: 1. Experts claim it only lasted five minutes. 2. It had been deemed biased as Eugene\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s mother tongue (Ukrainian) wasn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t equivalent to the judge\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s (English), which is a plus as language is one among the few ways we will tell the difference between a person\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s and machine. 2018 Alibaba\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s AI Model performs better than humans during a reading and comprehension test at Stanford University, scoring 82.44 against the 82.304 scored by humans! Concerns about AI Artificial Intelligence (AI) is here to remain, and lots of people aren\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t happy. After all, it\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s hard to embrace something that would displace about 40 percent of human jobs within the next 15 years. In an interview for CBS\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s hour, Kai-Fu Lee (a Chinese AI expert) also mentioned truck drivers, chauffeurs, waiters, and chefs as a number of the professions that will be disrupted. But if you were to ask the experts, they might unwaveringly confirm that no matter all the noise, AI is here to profit us all. Case in point, an executive briefing by the McKinsey Global Institute revealed that AI and automation are creating opportunities for the economy, society, and business. That said, it\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s time to repress the widespread idea of artificial intelligence taking jobs. So, let\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s highlight a number of the useful developments you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll expect from this technological phenomenon. AI will create jobs While the relationship between artificial intelligence and jobs is a matter of hot debate, it is still safe to say that AI will indeed offer new opportunities. According to the planet Economic Forum report, robots and AI will create as many AI jobs as they displace. This conclusion is entirely viable as it is easy to identify some of the many careers in artificial intelligence, for example, data scientists, who evaluate the decisions made by AI algorithms to eliminate any biases. Apart from that, some other AI occupations include: Transparency analysts: people tasked with classifying the varied sorts of opacity for algorithms. Smart-system interaction modelers: experts who develop machine behavior based on employee behavior. Machine-relations managers: people that champion the greater use of algorithms that perform well. As far because the competition for jobs between humans and robots goes, worth noting is that there are jobs that AI can\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t replace. Roles that need leadership, empathy, and delegation are samples of the various jobs that are safe from automation. AI will eliminate bias and a variety of challenges at work Automation will stir positive change in the workplace. When AI is employed during recruitment or maybe performance management, all workers are going to be evaluated in an unbiased, fact-based manner. In turn, Human Resources managers can get to consider other essential strategic undertakings that ensure balance within the workplace. AI can help HR departments to use machine learning (ML) in discovering where issues like bias stem from and assist them to act accordingly faster. ML shines in identifying instances of bias. In turn, this may promote fairness and variety within the work setting. AI in the workplace will steer business-outcome strategies The impact of AI in business is already felt, and this is often expected to continue through to the longer term. A few years from now, AI-oriented architecture is forecasted to require the lead in assisting businesses to hold out operations in additional comprehensive ways, thus shifting them from traditional data science and machine learning models. It will be necessary to maneuver to business outcomes because AI will play an important role in multiple aspects of the business. While there is no way of telling the future of artificial intelligence in business for sure, it makes sense for owners to keep up with the evolution to avoid being left behind. AI will boost innovation within the workplace in the longer term The workforce of the longer term will lean more towards innovation and creativity. Businesses have spent higher a part of the previous couple of years studying AI automation and the way they will leverage it to realize results fast. With statistics showing that workers spend up to 40 percent of their hours at work performing repetitive tasks, every business should consider automating any functions which will be automated. Automation is not new; machines have been replacing human labor in different areas for decades. However, within the coming years, mundane daily tasks will become fully automated. Already, 39 percent of organizations were completely reliant on automation in 2018. With repetitive tasks taken care of, employees can focus their energies on high-value customer-oriented tasks and collaboration. The designs of workplaces and workflows will also change with the implementation of AI technology. More people will begin to figure more closely with machines as companies will strive to become more agile. Companies that implement AI in their business strategy will experience dramatic improvements in their customer experiences, and their employees are going to be more motivated. Encouraging creativity rather than the performance of repetitive tasks gives workers more fulfillment in their jobs as well. With another technology, AI will positively impact the world With the web of things and AI working hand in hand, identifying trends and solving problems within the business world will become more convenient and also sustainable. AI, alongside other technologies, is predicted to vary the planet by impacting the way businesses run. With time, we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll be ready to combine both human and artificial brains to seek out solutions to major global problems. It will even be easier to foresee problems with more accuracy and nip them at the bud with the help of AI. But these positive impacts can only be felt if stakeholders are transparent and mindful in their use of the technology for the greater good of everyone else. Robotics and AI will boost productivity According to a report by PWC, 54 percent of companies confirm that the implementation of AI-driven solutions in their companies has already improved productivity. AI and automation, even once they are implemented partially, have unlimited potential for any business. Workers\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 skills, attitude, training, command chain, and workflows protocols are a number of the leading productivity challenges that companies face. Apart from increasing productivity, AI systems will help businesses to chop down on costs, improve the standard of their products or services, and make better customer profiles. As a result, companies also will get higher profits, which may be shared among stakeholders as dividends, or reinvest it back within the business. Improved productivity also means firms are going to be ready to sell their products at lower prices, thereby creating more demand among customers and more job opportunities for workers. Businesses can, therefore, use human labor to take up those jobs that have been created by AI and cannot be automated. Final thoughts on the impact of AI on jobs Artificial Intelligence isn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t showing any signs of slowing down. Soon, it\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll become another necessity of life, a bit like the web. But for now, more and more businesses are beginning to realize how invaluable AI automation and data interpretation are. Though machines will take some jobs initially, the roles created by automation will also keep soaring within the next few years. Will, we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve reached the purpose of accelerating human intelligence by artificial means? Who knows? What we all know, however, is that those that are going to be sought-after in AI and employment are individuals who have the relevant skills. There\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s work that not even the machines can do; so, we should make ourselves as valuable as we can be in our field and we will be irreplaceable. Blackcoffer Insights 28: Adrita Anan, Holy Cross College, Tejgaon, Dhaka\",\n          \"COVID 19 has bought the world to its knees. With businesses being shut, travel being banned, schools, and colleges being closed, we have observed an impeccable amount of sorrow and despise along with a great amount of mental torture and destruction. Though situations are improving now, and the lockdowns are being lifted, it is a fact that it cannot be shunned that this virus will have a long term impact on people, and the effects will not only be felt economically and physically but also mentally. We\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve been reading articles regarding the impact of COVID 19 on the economy, education, mental health, and every other possible aspect. But one topic which has not been talked about much is the impact of COVID 19 on office space and co-working industries. Well, it is quite obvious that offices will start functioning now, but, the COVID period hasn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t ended. This means that social distancing will also have to be followed in offices; where it will be a problem to do so because of the lack of adequate infrastructure and space. The same will be the condition in co-working industries, wherein employees of different companies come and work together under the same roof. However, these problems are quite obvious (though people haven\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t thought about them much), but the fact which people fail to notice and understand is that the meaning of space is not only limited to infrastructural space which is measured in square foot or square meters; but it also extends to metal space, or for that fact, space in the minds of people for others and their thoughts as well as opinions. Coronavirus has left a big scratch in our country; just the way a car needs repair after an accident, our country will also need repair after the control of this virus. But, unlike a car, our country will require a large amount of time to get restored and to stand straight without any support. Needless to say, the economic stability of our country will definitely be hit because of this reason. But the problem is since the earnings of the employers will reduce, it will subsequently lead to a drop in the salary of the employees. While some employees might be preferred by their bosses and may receive a raise regularly, others might be subjected to unfair treatment and made to do the same amount of work for a lower salary. People tend to overlook the thin line which exists between cooperation and competition. The problem doesn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t arise when such a situation happens wherein an employee is getting paid more than the other, but instead, it arises when people start to compare their earnings as well as benefits to that of others. And in today\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s world, where people keep money at the top of their priority list, comparisons will play a very important role in the performance of employees and their company. Since there will exist inequalities and partialities in companies, there will also exist a sense of hatred and competition among the employees of the same company; who will compete to get a better position or a raise in their salary. This may seem beneficial to some as it might compel the employees to work harder and better, but however, will bring huge losses in the long run. The fact is; employees might end up doing unethical acts which will help them to make a better impression in their boss\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s eyes. Moreover, since there will be comparisons among the employees, it might happen that the \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0098Employee of the Month\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 ends up being hated by all other employees in the company. Another situation that might arise is that of bluffing and pretending; wherein employees tend to show that they work very hard but they don\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t. This might be practiced by showing the boss that they are working when he is on around, and then chilling the rest of the time when the boss goes home or sits in his office. In fact, employees might also lose interest in working if they sense repeated partialities and inequalities; which they might show by quitting the jobs or not performing to their best. Such situations will definitely arise in companies and offices; wherein employees will compete for attention and resources; which will have a great impact on the company and its functioning. And all this will happen because of only one thing; lack of office mental space i.e. space in the minds of people working together in a particular office for cooperation and teamwork, along with ignorance of the fact that things will get better and eventually the same after some time. Another kind of industry and companies that will be affected due to the long-lasting impact of COVID 19 is the co-working industry and offices. This is because, there will be a shortage of resources and the income of people, but the maintenance cost to be born for the infrastructure, as well the rent will remain the same. Because of this, employees will be told by the company owners to exploit the resources present in the offices and use them to the fullest; to compensate for the losses being born and to make better use of the money being used. However, the number of resources will be the same, and so, there will be a case of competition between employees of different companies to use resources and take benefits of the same. If the above two situations happen to occur at the same time (which they most likely will), we will observe a scene of intra-company as well as inter-company competition. Also, our personal relations with other employees in the company might also be affected due to this comparison and competition; which itself will be a result of limited mental space. COVID 19 will have severe impacts on the office (mental) space of companies and people.\\u00c2\\u00a0 People\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s thoughts, how they treat others, along with accepting defeat and rejection will be an important aspect of everyone\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s lives. Moreover, we might also observe a shoot in the intensity and frequency of office people going to psychologists; because of repeated rejection and unfair treatment. However, we need to cope with this thing and realize that it is indeed very important for us to start preparing to expand our mental space and that this competition and comparison will not stay for long and should not affect our personal relations and life at any cost.
